<!-- I'm Leandro Stival PhD student at IC/UNICAMP, currently I'm studying machine learning and digital image processing. My current tese focus on monochromatic video colorization using deep learning, more specifically using graph convolutional network with a mechanism of self-attention. -->

My name is Leandro Stival, and I am a researcher specializing in artificial intelligence and computer science. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where I specialized in deep learning and computer vision applied to remote sensing and video processing.

Throughout my professional journey, I have cultivated expertise in diverse domains of machine learning, with a particular focus on the analysis of satellite imagery and multispectral data for environmental monitoring and land use classification. I have also worked with data from other domains, including sports analytics. In this capacity, I applied AI techniques to analyze football match data. In addition to that, I've developed projects involving video colorization using deep learning models and worked on time series analysis for various applications.

I am particularly interested in leveraging AI to address real-world challenges. I find satisfaction in working with data to reveal insights and support decision-making, whether it's understanding landscapes from space or analyzing patterns on a football field.
