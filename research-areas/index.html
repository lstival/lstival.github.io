        <h1>Research Areas</h1>
        <p>My research program is dedicated to the development of autonomous systems capable of learning from complex,
            high-dimensional, and multimodal data without human supervision. By bridging modern machine learning with
            Earth sciences, I aim to create foundation models that are scalable, generalizable, and scientifically
            informative.</p>

        <section class="research-area">
            <h2>Self-Supervised & Contrastive Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Scope:</strong> Traditional deep learning relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets,
                which are prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to acquire in domains like remote sensing or
                scientific time series.</p>
            <p><strong>Methods:</strong> I develop self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, including contrastive
                learning (SimCLR, MoCo) and masked autoencoders (MAE), tailored for non-natural image domains. This
                involves designing data augmentation strategies that preserve physical and spectral properties.</p>
            <p><strong>Scientific Contribution:</strong> These methods enable models to learn invariant and high-level
                representations from raw, unlabeled sensor data, significantly reducing the labeled data requirement for
                downstream tasks such as classification and anomaly detection.</p>

        <section class="research-area">
            <h2>Multimodal Representation Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Scope:</strong> Environmental and satellite data are inherently multimodal, encompassing
                multispectral bands, temporal sequences, and spatial context. Conventional models often fail to capture
                the synergy between these diverse sources.</p>
            <p><strong>Methods:</strong> I research architecturally fused models that align different modalities into a
                unified embedding space. This includes cross-modal attention mechanisms and joint SSL objectives that
                leverage the complementarity of spectral and spatial information.</p>
            <p><strong>Scientific Contribution:</strong> My work facilitates the creation of "foundation models" for
                Earth observation, capable of performing zero-shot or few-shot transfer across different sensor types
                and geographical regions.</p>

        <section class="research-area">
            <h2>Spatio-Temporal Modeling & Video Understanding</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Scope:</strong> Modeling dynamic processes—such as vegetation phenology or urban
                expansion—requires capturing dependencies across both space and time, often in the presence of noise or
                missing data (e.g., cloud cover).</p>
            <p><strong>Methods:</strong> I utilize Transformers, State-Space Models (SSMs), and recurrent architectures
                to model long-range temporal dependencies. My research in video colorization also informs how temporal
                consistency can be enforced in generative tasks.</p>
            <p><strong>Scientific Contribution:</strong> These approaches improve the accuracy of temporal forecasting
                and change detection, providing more reliable data for climate monitoring and agricultural planning.</p>

            <h2>Remote Sensing & Earth Observation</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Scope:</strong> Interpreting satellite imagery requires addressing domain-specific
                challenges such as atmospheric effects, varying resolutions, and the lack of ground truth.</p>
            <p><strong>Methods:</strong> I apply representation learning specifically to multispectral and hyperspectral
                imagery, focusing on semantically-aware contrastive learning and land-use/land-cover classification.</p>
            <p><strong>Scientific Contribution:</strong> By developing AI tools specifically for Earth observation, I
                contribute to more precise environmental monitoring, enabling the tracking of biodiversity,
                deforestation, and agricultural productivity at a global scale.</p>
