# Research Interests

My research focuses on advancing **self-supervised learning (SSL)** and **representation learning** for complex and multimodal data. I investigate how state-of-the-art SSL methods — originally developed for vision and language — can be extended to time series, remote sensing, and other domain-specific data.

## 🧠 Core Research Areas

### Self-Supervised Learning

I explore SSL frameworks that enable models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This involves developing training strategies that capture:

- **Temporal dependencies** in sequential data
- **Cross-modal relations** between different data types
- **Contextual patterns** without manual annotations
- **Invariant features** across transformations

By leveraging contrastive learning, masked modeling, and other SSL paradigms, I aim to create models that autonomously discover structure in diverse data sources.

### Modern Architectures

A central component of my work is the exploration of SSL frameworks that integrate modern architectures:

- **🔍 Attention Mechanisms** - Capturing long-range dependencies and relationships
- **🤖 Transformers** - Flexible sequence modeling across domains
- **⚡ State-Space Models (SSMs)** - Efficient processing of long sequences
- **🌊 Diffusion Models** - Generative modeling and representation learning

These approaches provide flexible and efficient representations capable of modeling complex behaviors. By combining ideas from differential equations, signal processing, and neural attention, I design systems that are both theoretically grounded and computationally scalable.

### Multimodal Learning

I investigate methods for learning from multiple data modalities simultaneously:

- **Vision + Language** - Cross-modal understanding and retrieval
- **Time Series + Metadata** - Temporal patterns with contextual information
- **Spectral + Spatial Data** - Remote sensing and multispectral analysis
- **Audio + Visual** - Multimodal perception and fusion

The goal is to develop unified representations that capture complementary information across modalities.

## 🚀 Research Philosophy

Beyond algorithmic development, my research focuses on **applying SSL and machine learning methods across different domains** to enhance performance and generate new insights from experimental data. This includes:

1. **Adaptability** - Adapting multimodal SSL models to extract cross-domain representations
2. **Generalization** - Improving model generalization across diverse datasets
3. **Interpretability** - Revealing underlying patterns that traditional techniques fail to capture
4. **Scalability** - Designing computationally efficient solutions for large-scale data

Ultimately, my goal is to create **generalizable and interpretable learning frameworks** that bridge modern machine learning with domain-specific discovery and analysis.
