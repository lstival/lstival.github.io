### Transformer-Based Models for Time Series Analysis

**International Conference on Machine Learning 2024**

**Authors:** Your Name, Collaborator D, Collaborator E

We present a transformer-based architecture specifically designed for time series forecasting and anomaly detection.

#### Abstract

We present a transformer-based architecture specifically designed for time series forecasting and anomaly detection. By incorporating temporal positional encodings and specialized attention mechanisms, our model captures long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional approaches.
