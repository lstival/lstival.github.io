        <h1>Projects & Datasets</h1>
        <p>This section outlines key research projects and released datasets. These efforts focus on advancing
            self-supervised learning for multimodal and spatiotemporal applications.</p>

        <section class="project-item">
            <h2>Self-Supervised Learning for Remote Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Developing robust vision models for satellite imagery without
                extensive ground truth labels.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> This project investigates semantically-aware contrastive learning and
                masked modeling for multispectral data. By leveraging temporal and spectral invariants, we build
                representations that generalize across diverse environmental conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Modality:</strong> Multispectral Satellite Imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat).</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> Published research papers and releases for SSL benchmarking in Earth
                observation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-item">
            <h2>Temporal Consistent Video Colorization (CVC/CAVC)</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Restoring color to grayscale video sequences while maintaining
                temporal coherence and avoiding flickering artifacts.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> We developed attention-based autoencoders (CAVC) and contrastive learning
                strategies (CVC) to capture long-range dependencies in video. The approach emphasizes temporal
                consistency through shared-weight attention and diffusion-inspired refinements.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Modality:</strong> Natural Video, Animation Sequences.</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> Multiple publications in VISAPP, IntelliSys, and ICMLA; open-source
                implementations.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-item">
            <h2>AI in Sports Analytics</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Identifying strategic patterns and predicting high-value events
                (e.g., entry into the attack zone) from spatiotemporal athlete tracking data.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Utilizing specialized machine learning pipelines to analyze the initial
                seconds of ball possession. The project involves feature engineering for spatial dynamics and evaluating
                predictive reliability in high-stakes environments.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Modality:</strong> Spatiotemporal Tracking Data (Football/Soccer).</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> Published research in <em>PLOS ONE</em>; methodologies for tactical performance
                analysis.</p>
