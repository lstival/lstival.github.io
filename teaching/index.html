        <h1>Teaching Experience</h1>
        <p>I am committed to academic excellence through teaching and mentorship, bridging the gap between theoretical
            machine learning and practical application. My teaching philosophy emphasizes hands-on experience, critical
            thinking, and interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
