# About

My name is **Leandro Stival**, and I am a researcher specializing in **artificial intelligence** and **computer science**. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where I specialized in **deep learning** and **computer vision** applied to **remote sensing** and **video processing**.

Throughout my professional journey, I have cultivated expertise in diverse domains of machine learning, with a particular focus on the analysis of **satellite imagery** and **multispectral data** for environmental monitoring and land use classification. I have also worked with data from other domains, including **sports analytics**. In this capacity, I applied AI techniques to analyze football match data. In addition to that, I’ve developed projects involving **video colorization** using deep learning models and worked on **time series analysis** for various applications.

I am particularly interested in leveraging AI to address real-world challenges. I find satisfaction in working with data to reveal insights and support decision-making, whether it’s understanding landscapes from space or analyzing patterns on a sport science field.

## Current Position

**PostDoc Researcher**  
Wageningen University & Research (WUR)  
Wageningen, Netherlands

## Research Focus

My research focuses on advancing **self-supervised learning (SSL)** and **representation learning** for complex and multimodal data. I investigate how state-of-the-art SSL methods can be extended to various domains, developing training strategies that capture dependencies and contextual patterns without the need for labeled data.

## Fun Facts 🎉

- 🎨 I enjoy visualizing embeddings projections (they're basically modern art!)
- 🧠 My ideal debugging companion: coffee ☕ and synthwave music 🎵
- 🚀 Always excited about the next breakthrough in ML (especially if does not require labeled data)
