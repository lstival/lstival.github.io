### CAVC: Cosine Attention Video Colorization

**VISAPP 2024 - 19th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications**

**Authors:** L. Stival, R. S. da Torres, H. Pedrini

**Conference:** Rome, Italy, February 27-29, 2024

This paper proposes a novel approach to video colorization utilizing a single attention head with shared weights and cosine similarity for refining monochromatic frames. The architecture was trained on DAVIS, UVO, and LDV datasets and achieved superior results compared to state-of-the-art models in terms of the FID metric.

#### Abstract

Example-based video colorization methods use a reference image to colorize a monochromatic video. This paper proposes CAVC (Cosine Attention Video Colorization), which uses a single attention head with shared weights and cosine similarity for refining monochromatic frames as a pre-processing step for an autoencoder that performs feature fusion. The architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

**Authors:** L. Stival, H. Pedrini

**Published:** May 2023

This comprehensive survey analyzes state-of-the-art techniques in video colorization, including commonly used colorization and machine learning techniques, as well as color space and correlated methods to enhance results. Unlike other reviews, this paper focuses on solutions for both natural video and animation, highlighting the unique challenges of achieving temporal color consistency.

#### Abstract

Video colorization is a challenging task that involves adding color information to grayscale video sequences. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art techniques, covering both traditional and deep learning-based approaches. We discuss the main challenges, including temporal consistency, and review methods for both natural videos and animation.

### Using Machine Learning Pipeline to Predict Entry into the Attack Zone in Football

**PLOS ONE**

**Authors:** L. Stival, A. Pinto, F. dos Santos Pinto de Andrade, P. R. P. Santiago, H. Biermann, R. da Silva Torres, U. Dias

**Published:** January 18, 2023

This research focuses on determining if analyzing the first five seconds after a team gains ball possession provides enough information to predict whether the ball will reach the final quarter of the soccer field. The methodology models players' interactions as graph structures and extracts metrics, encoding them into two-dimensional representations of visual rhythms for feature extraction through deep convolutional networks.

#### Abstract

This paper presents a machine learning pipeline to predict entry into the attack zone in football by analyzing the initial moments of ball possession. We model player interactions as graph structures and use deep convolutional networks to predict offensive outcomes. Our findings indicate that offensive play near the opponent's penalty area can be predicted by observing the initial five seconds of ball possession.
