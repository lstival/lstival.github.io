# Research Interests

My research centers on advancing **self-supervised learning (SSL)** and **representation learning** for complex, temporal, and multimodal data — with strong emphasis on **spatiotemporal modeling**, **self-supervised learning** (SSL), and **scientific data analysis**. I investigate how cutting-edge SSL methods, originally developed for vision and language, can be adapted to time series, satellite imagery, video, and other domain-specific modalities.

## 🌟 Research Vision: Self-Supervised Learning Meets Explainability

The long-term goal of my research is to develop **self-supervised learning systems that are not only data-efficient but also inherently interpretable**.  
I envision SSL methods that:

- learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,  
- reveal *how* patterns are extracted from the original signals, and  
- provide **transparent, trustworthy, and scientifically meaningful explanations**.

This vision combines SSL with explainability to build models that are scalable, energy-efficient, and aligned with sustainable computing principles — enabling a new generation of machine learning systems that are both powerful and understandable.

## 🧠 Core Research Areas

### Self-Supervised & Representation Learning

I design SSL frameworks that enable models to learn high-quality representations without labels. My work focuses on:

- **Temporal dependencies** in sequential and environmental data  
- **Cross-modal relations** across spatial, spectral, and temporal sources  
- **Contextual and structural patterns** without annotations  
- **Generalizable and invariant features** across modalities  

I leverage contrastive learning, masked modeling, reconstruction tasks, and hybrid SSL paradigms to uncover structure in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets.

### Modern and Hybrid Architectures

I explore architectures that enhance SSL for multimodal and spatiotemporal data, including:

- **🔍 Attention mechanisms** for long-range dependencies  
- **🤖 Transformers** for flexible multimodal sequence modeling  
- **⚡ State-Space Models (SSMs)** for efficient long-sequence processing  
- **🌊 Signal-processing & differential-equation inspired models** for principled learning  

These architectural directions support both **scalability** and **interpretability**, connecting deep learning with theoretical foundations.

### Multimodal Spatio-Temporal Learning

I investigate methods for learning unified representations using multiple modalities:

- **Multispectral + spatial data** (remote sensing)  
- **Time series + metadata**  
- **Video + temporal interactions**  

My focus is on developing **modality-agnostic frameworks** that integrate complementary information and extract meaningful scientific patterns.

## 🚀 Research Philosophy

My research is driven by four principles:

1. **Adaptability** — solutions that generalize across data types, regions, and domains.  
2. **Generalization** — robust performance in low-label and cross-modal scenarios.  
3. **Interpretability** — models that reveal *why* and *how* patterns are learned.  
4. **Scalability** — efficient methods that reduce energy, computation, and resource demands.  

Ultimately, I aim to build **transparent, theoretically grounded, and sustainable** SSL frameworks that connect modern machine learning with scientific discovery.
