        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Leandro Stival</strong>, and I am a researcher specializing in <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where I specialized in <strong>deep learning</strong> and <strong>computer vision</strong> applied to <strong>remote sensing</strong> and <strong>video processing</strong>.</p>
        <p>Throughout my professional journey, I have cultivated expertise in diverse domains of machine learning, with a particular focus on the analysis of <strong>satellite imagery</strong> and <strong>multispectral data</strong> for environmental monitoring and land use classification. I have also worked with data from other domains, including <strong>sports analytics</strong>. In this capacity, I applied AI techniques to analyze football match data. In addition to that, I’ve developed projects involving <strong>video colorization</strong> using deep learning models and worked on <strong>time series analysis</strong> for various applications.</p>
        <p>I am particularly interested in leveraging AI to address real-world challenges. I find satisfaction in working with data to reveal insights and support decision-making, whether it’s understanding landscapes from space or analyzing patterns on a sport science field.</p>
        <h2>Current Position</h2>
        <p><strong>PostDoc Researcher</strong><br>
        Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR)<br>
        Wageningen, Netherlands</p>
        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>My research focuses on advancing <strong>self-supervised learning (SSL)</strong> and <strong>representation learning</strong> for complex and multimodal data. I investigate how state-of-the-art SSL methods can be extended to various domains, developing training strategies that capture dependencies and contextual patterns without the need for labeled data.</p>
        <h2>Fun Facts 🎉</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🎨 I enjoy visualizing embeddings projections (they're basically modern art!)</li>
            <li>🧠 My ideal debugging companion: coffee ☕ and synthwave music 🎵</li>
            <li>🚀 Always excited about the next breakthrough in ML (especially if does not require labeled data)</li>
        </ul>
