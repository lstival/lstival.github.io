            <h2>Current Role and Institutional Context</h2>
            <p>Leandro Stival is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Artificial Intelligence Group at Wageningen University
                & Research (WUR), Netherlands. His research is situated at the intersection of advanced machine learning
                and environmental science, with a primary focus on developing scalable, self-supervised representation
                learning frameworks for multimodal spatiotemporal data.</p>

            <h2>Research Methodologies and Scientific Inquiries</h2>
            <p>My work investigates how high-dimensional, unlabeled data from Satellite Imagery (Remote Sensing), Video,
                and Time Series can be utilized to build generalizable foundation models. I employ techniques from
                contrastive learning, masked autoencoders, space state models and generative modeling to autonomously
                discover structural patterns in Earth observation data.</p>
            <p>Key scientific questions I address include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How can self-supervised learning capture long-range temporal dependencies in irregular environmental
                    time series?</li>
                <li>To what extent can cross-modal alignment between multispectral and spatial data improve
                    representation robustness?</li>
                <li>How can we design domain-agnostic architectures that generalize across diverse geographical regions
                    and sensor types?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Academic Biography</h2>
            <p>Leandro Stival earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil,
                where his doctoral research focused on self-supervised deep learning and computer vision applied to
                video colorization and spatiotemporal analysis. During his doctoral studies, he conducted a research
                period at Wageningen University & Research, focusing on remote sensing applications. His academic
                background is characterized by a strong foundation in computer science, specifically in digital signal
                processing, graph theory, and neural network architectures.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, he has published in high-impact venues such as the <em>ISPRS Journal of
                    Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em>. His research spans multiple
                application domains, including change detection on earth observation, natural video processing, and
                sports analytics, demonstrating a commitment to interdisciplinary AI. Currently, he
                contributes to the development of AI-driven solutions for Earth observation, aiming to bridge the gap
                between theoretical machine learning and practical environmental monitoring challenges.</p>
